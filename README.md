# Car-parking-detection
Car Parking detection  <br/> For Detection of cars, pretrained model from mask R-CNN was used. Link to the github profile:-
https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN <br/> The model of RCNN used here was trained for cars detection using COCO dataset which have mask and bounding boxes provided on each car in the dataset <br/> camera3 folder contains images on one parking lot. For successful implementation we need a few images of any parking lot and it will work successfully on it.
